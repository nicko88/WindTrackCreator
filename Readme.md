### Getting Started

* Open up WindTrackCreator.
* Load the movie you want to work on in your MPC-HC/BE or Kodi media player.
* Enter in the connection information for your media player.
* Seek through the movie and press the OFF, ECO, LOW, MED, and HIGH buttons (or their cooresponding numpad hotkeys) to insert fan commands at that time.
* You can click the Seek button to jump to an existing fan command time.
* Don't forget to save your work when you are done.

### Sharing Your Wind Track Files

I encourage you to post and share the wind track files you make with others over on the community forum.  Someone there will then upload your wind track to the online database on Pastebin [here](https://pastebin.com/u/SOWK).

When your wind track is uploaded to the pastebin database, it will also become available for other users to download directly from their HTFanControl web interface.
